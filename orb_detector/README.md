# ORB Detector Implementation

This project implements the **ORB** (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF) pipeline, which is commonly used in computer vision for detecting and describing key points in images. The ORB algorithm combines the FAST keypoint detector and the BRIEF descriptor to provide efficient and effective feature matching. The project focuses on a manual implementation of the key components of the ORB pipeline, particularly the keypoints detection using an improved version of the FAST detector.

## Project Overview

The project involves implementing the ORB pipeline for detecting keypoints and descriptors, which are crucial for tasks such as image matching, 3D reconstruction, and more. The implementation emphasizes a deep understanding of the underlying algorithms, particularly the FAST keypoint detector, and includes:

- **Keypoint Detection**: Using the FAST detector to identify distinctive features in images.
- **Harris Corner Measure**: Applying the Harris corner measure to filter out less significant keypoints.
- **Image Pyramid Creation**: Constructing multi-scale representations of images to detect features at various scales.

## Task Description

The original outline and goals for this project are documented in a file named `task_description.md`. This document includes detailed instructions and guidelines for implementing the ORB pipeline, focusing on the keypoint detection part of the ORB algorithm. It served as a foundational plan guiding the implementation process. The `task_description.md` file can be referred to for a comprehensive understanding of the project's initial objectives and scope.

## Implementation Details

### Key Components

- **FAST Keypoints Detector**: The project implements the FAST algorithm by comparing the intensity of a pixel with its surrounding pixels arranged in a circle (Bresenham circle). If a pixel's intensity significantly differs from its neighbors, it is marked as a keypoint.
- **Harris Corner Measure**: After detecting keypoints, the Harris corner measure is applied to evaluate the "cornerness" of these points, ensuring only the most significant keypoints are retained.
- **Image Pyramid**: The implementation includes building an image pyramid to detect keypoints at multiple scales, which is essential for recognizing features regardless of the image size or resolution.

### File Structure

- **orb.py**: Contains the main implementation of the ORB pipeline, including the `fast`, `create_pyramid`, `detect_keypoints`, and other helper functions.
- **utils.py**: Provides utility functions such as Gaussian filtering, used within the ORB implementation.
- **test_orb.py**: Contains test cases to validate the correctness of the implemented functions using pytest.
- **orb.ipynb**: A Jupyter Notebook showcasing the application of the ORB pipeline on sample images, demonstrating the detection and matching of keypoints.

## Usage

To utilize the ORB detector, load an image, and apply the `fast` function to detect keypoints. For example:

```python
import cv2
import orb

image = cv2.imread('path/to/your/image.jpg', cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)
keypoints = orb.fast(image, threshold=20, n_pyr_levels=8, downscale_factor=1.2)
```
The above script reads an image, converts it to grayscale, and detects keypoints using the ORB pipeline.

## Testing

The functionality of the ORB implementation is validated through comprehensive tests in `test_orb.py`. The tests cover various aspects of the keypoint detection and filtering processes, ensuring robust and accurate implementation.
```bash
python3 test_orb.py
```

## Dependencies

- `numpy`: Used for numerical operations and image representation.
- `opencv-python`: For image processing tasks like reading and manipulating images.
- `pytest`: For testing the implementation.

Install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy opencv-python pytest
```

## Conclusion

This project provides a detailed implementation of the ORB keypoint detector, with a focus on understanding and applying fundamental concepts in computer vision. The implementation can be extended to include other parts of the ORB pipeline, such as the BRIEF descriptor, to further enhance feature matching capabilities.
